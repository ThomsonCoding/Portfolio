The title for this project is NYT - Movie Review portal, this connects to the New York Times API, pulling the data on movies that they have reviewed and also provides a link to the review itself.

My motivation was to continue practicing with API's and by doing this on the 4 API projects, I can help cement the knowledge for future applications. APIs are important as they allow the capabilities of one computer program to be used by another, and by being able to use them confidently I can broaden my range of use on applications.

I built this project with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS, ensuring that it remained responsive and that the performance of the site remained high.

If you do have any questions regarding this application, please reach out to me via my portfolio.
