  <h3>Events</h3>
  <li>Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or when a button has been clicked).</li>
  <li>Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon</li>
  <li>When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.</li>
  <li>You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.</li>
  <li>The most commonly used events are W3C DOM events, although there are others in the HTML5 specification as well as browser-specific events.</li>
