This project was one I made whilst going through Jon Duckettâ€™s JavaScript and jQuery book for the second time. Understanding the fundamentals and having a resource I could look back has helped me tackle issues in both projects since then and challenges on code wars.

I made this application as it helped me practice and understand how JavaScript works in greater depth.

It covers a range of topics containing both explanations and coding examples.

If you have any queries regarding this, please reach out to me via my portfolio.
