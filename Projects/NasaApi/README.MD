The title for this project is "NASA Space portal", this connects to various NASA APIs pulling new data every day. Following a brief into to NASA, it provides their photo of the day, a picture from EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera), many photos from the curiosity rover and finally a link to the weather on MARS. It does this by connecting to various API's provided by NASA.

For this project I used HTML, CSS, vanilla JS and jQuery. I added jQuery as it allowed me to create some functionality in a simplified version (Compare to Vanilla JS). If you want more depth on when this was used, please see the comments within the code.

The reason for creating this project was to get more familiar with API's as well as focusing on creating a responsive website. Whilst sticking to a NASA theme, I have managed to achieve this, and look to keep some of the skills developed for future projects.

If you do have any questions regarding this application, please reach out to me via my portfolio.
