The purpose of the project was to redevelop The Salisbury Ale House website, my goal was to make it responsive and add more features than the current one which is created by word press.

Features:
Booking system imbedded.
Ale search section.
Easy contact systems.

Whilst making the site I had aimed to keep the character of the pub on show, I feel that my experience of working within this pub as a supervisor helps me understand this, allowing me to demonstrate some of their main selling points (Ales and Pizza).

If you do have any questions regarding this, please contact me via my portfolio.
