The name of this project is Country Top Trumps, this connects to the Rest Countries API and pulls various information such as: Flag, Population, Region, Capital and connecting countries. The purpose of this project was to practice connecting to the API and experimenting with the data I can pull. Whilst also ensuring the performance of the website was high (speed, best practices, SEO, etc).

I built this project with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS, if you do have any questions regarding this application, please reach out to me via my portfolio.
