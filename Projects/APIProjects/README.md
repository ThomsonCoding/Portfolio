The name of this project is "The API HUB", the main goal of this was to act as a menu for applications I have created using various API's.

The menu holds 4 different applications, the Weather app, country information app, NY times movie review search portal and finally the NASA space app. Each of these have their own read me files, going into more depth. Each of these applications have been created with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS and brief examples of jQuery.

The menu on this portal is responsive and will provide both the GITHUB link to the code/readme files, and a link to the live application.

If you do have any questions regarding the portal or any of the applications created, please reach out to me via my portfolio.
