The Weather APP is the first of the four applications found within my API Project. It connecrs to the Open weather map API, which is a free API that provides weather updates for cities around the world. You simply enter a citie and it will load up todays, tomorros and the day afters weather report.

I used HTML, CSS and JS to complete this project. I also ensured that it was responsive and had a quick loading time.

If you have any questions regarding this application, please contact me via my portfolio.
