Welcome to my Spotify clone, this is one of my earlier projects. I created this project after viewing a video online regarding interviews and interview/prep. In the video they had informed us that they had to create a clone as part of the process. Whilst they had never done this before they felt that they learnt a lot.

I picked Spotify as it is an application, I have on my laptop all the time, listening to music whilst I code away.

I originally intended to do just the main front page, although one thing led to another and I had created various playlists, etc.

If I was to complete this again, I would focus on reusability of the code and also use colour variables more often within my CSS. Although I do feel my Spotify application is visually appealing and takes away many of the features found on the site.

I learnt a lot and it has helped me focus on various features you can use within CSS.

If you have any questions regarding this project, please contact me via my portfolio.
